"""
Functional tests should test your applications' interactions with
external systems.

Because you need to coordinate with other services, these can be the most challenging
and time-consuming tests to write and maintain. However, because you are actually
interacting with other systems (instead of fakes), these tests provide the most realistic
feedback that your application is functioning as intended.
